# Neural Style Transfer implementation using Keras and tensorflow

Neural style transfer algorithm consists of applying the style of a reference image to a target image while conserving the content of the target image.

The Algorithm has been introduced in 2015 Leon et al.(Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge, “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style,” arXiv (2015),
https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576.)


Note:
The implementation is inspired from the book :"Deep learning with python by francois chollet"
